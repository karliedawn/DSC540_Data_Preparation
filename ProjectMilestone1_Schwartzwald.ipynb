    "I plan to start this project by converting all data formats into data frames.  For the GDP I will need to average all three estimates into one estimate for comparison purposes. From there, I will assign the column “Country” to be the index for each data frame. Then I can merge my data frames into one and have each country be a row with all the attributes needed as columns in one large data frame.  I need to make sure that each of my file sources has the correct corresponding year for each data source (2019 in this case.) Then I plan to search for outliers or empty cell values and remove those rows from the data frame. Finally, I can make three scatterplots between the features “Happiness Index”, “Gender Development Index”, and GDP. This will show me if there is a general trend in the data that is obviously visible or if further statistical analysis is needed. I would like to measure the correlation coefficient between these variables as well.   \n",

    "I think the biggest ethical implication from this project is that it is very difficult to quantify gender equality, as well as the happiness of a country, into just one number. Because of this, I think a lot of subtlety and nuance will be lost in this project. Furthermore, it would be uncomfortable to conclude that gender equality could be inversely correlated with happiness or GDP. While I do not expect this to be the case, I would have ethical issues with those findings and how they could be interpreted. I think the biggest challenge I will face will be merging all the datasets into one large data frame. "
